Back-end, is handled by Caleb Zhang and Runyu Yue, we finished all the operations that communicate with Realtime Database.
We commit our code to Master branch.

Caleb Zhang Github username is: kz4ever
Runyu Yue Github username is: Yry01

In general, we split the whole back-end work into 50:50, half. 
Ie, we implemented all the methods in the do.java and make sure all the methods work as we expected.

Caleb Zhang and Runyu Yue finish the back-end portion work together and all of the debugging.
We had meetings everday and we discussed the logic and problems together.   

We carefully find out all of the unexpected behaviour, bugs through massive testing with front-end developers and Scrum master. 
Caleb Zhang and Runyu Yue thoroughly debugged all the bugs.

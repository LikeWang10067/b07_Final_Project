 1. I debug the problem that how to fix a call back function return different value twice, and improve my cleaner function in order to return a list of oudtdated events in the database
 
 2. I am planning to test our app, to find any other potential bugs.
 
 3. can not think of an idea or logic can let my function does not return two times in some cases.

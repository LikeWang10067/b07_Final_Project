Runyu:
	
	I successfully implement the writing to database firebase.
	
	I plan to study how to read data from firebase and transfer it using the callback function.
	
	I knew that the direction of reading the data is going in the wrong direction and I am adjusting my thoughts.
	
Caleb:
	1.

	I am planning to  modulize the data classes in order to have clean strcture.
	I am planning to implement the log in authentication logic.

Finish onClick and onCreate for starter page, login page and sign up page
2. 
I need to communicate with Steven to let him know what should he build on .xml file
3. 
Haven't write onClick and onCreate method for CustomerPage and AdminPage, and these 2 page may also have sub-page, 
which make me worry about the deadline.
```
Runyu Yue:
```
1. 
Finish the user unjoin event, admin delete venue and event in back end
2. 
Need to finish the search venue method
3. 
Worried about the too complex structure implemented and we haven't test our methods
```

```
1.
We implemented the admain add event, and display time and fix many bugs.

Like Wang:
```
1. 
Write onClick and onCreate for starter page with Felix
2. 
I need to communicate with Steven to let him know what should he build on .xml file
3. 
There are sub-pages for CustomerPage and AdminPage, which is like a BST now, I hope it is not too much to write.
